                    With their latest critically acclaimed album 'Katharsis' released via Frontier Records in January
                    2022, Praying Mantis
                    continue to tour with their current band members Chris Troy, Tino Troy, Andy Burgess, John' Jaycee'
                    Cuijpers and Hans in
                    't Zandt. They are now producing music which is some of the best in their 50-year history, but where
                    did it all start?

                    <h3>Early Days</h3>
                    Praying Mantis were formed in London, England, in 1973 by brothers Chris and Tino Troy. The music
                    scene of the late '70s
                    was widely regarded as stagnant in the wake of a dying punk scene, so it became time for a new breed
                    of British bands to
                    emerge and establish themselves with their own creative style of music. A new movement was formed
                    through Neal Kay, DJ
                    at THE BANDWAGON, North London's premier hard rock disco. Today, this story has become folk law to
                    Hard Rock fans
                    worldwide. Due to Neal's much-appreciated support, Mantis were given a platform to air their music,
                    which featured the
                    classics 'Captured City' and 'Lovers to the Grave'. <br><br>
                    Along with fellow London bands Iron Maiden, Angel Witch and Samson, Praying Mantis quickly
                    established themselves and
                    rapidly received the attention of the music press of the time. Along with some similar bands across
                    the UK, this entire
                    movement was labelled by 'Sounds' as the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. <br> <br>

                    <p>
                        Spearheaded by Praying Mantis (and Iron Maiden), NWOBHM (as it became known) went on to dominate
                        the Hard Rock scene in
                        the early '80s, especially after the release of 'Metal for Muthas', a compilation album
                        consisting of bands that had
                        played at The Bandwagon. NWOBHM was just what the UK needed at the time: fresh, exciting music
                        with energetic live
                        performances and a togetherness that created a spirit of camaraderie between fans and bands
                        alike. <br> <br>

                        The debut album 'Time Tells No Lies' received critical acclaim, and the single 'Cheated' went
                        top 40 on the UK Charts in
                        1980. Iron Maiden and Praying Mantis were closely paired in many areas during this period and
                        formed a strong musical
                        relationship. They regularly played together through the promotion of 'Metal for Muthas', which
                        included an extensive UK
                        Tour. <br> <br>
                        In 1990 this relationship saw Dennis Stratton and Paul Di'Anno (ex-Iron Maiden) join Praying
                        Mantis on stage to
                        celebrate the 10th anniversary of the NWOBHM in Japan. Dennis later joined the band on a
                        full-time basis, as did Clive
                        Burr (ex-Iron Maiden) and Gary Barden (ex-MSG). <br> <br>
                        Since then, Praying Mantis have released many successful albums with Pony Canyon in Japan, and
                        this became one of the
                        band's major territories.

                    <h3>The New Millenium</h3>
                    <p>In 2007, guitarist Andy Burgess replaced Dennis Stratton in the line-up, continuing the dual lead
                        for the famous Mantis
                        guitar harmonies. He has also proved to be a strong songwriter and influence in the band.
                        <br><br>
                        In 2013, vocalist John Cuijpers and drummer Hans in 't Zandt joined the band replacing Mike
                        Freeland and Gary Mackenzie.
                        The Dutch duo has vast experience in their fields, having toured with Toto, Jeff Scott Soto, Mad
                        Max, Sinner and
                        Vengeance. This has added a new and exciting dimension to the band's music and live
                        performances.<br><br>
                        In 2015 'Legacy' formalised the new line-up, and the album received great reviews and sales all
                        over the world. The band
                        promoted the album by touring as far as Japan twice!<br><br>
                        The album 'GRAVITY' is hailed as one of the band's finest to date and still receives stunning
                        views worldwide. It was
                        well received in the album charts, reaching 23 in the UK, 70 in Switzerland and an impressive
                        number 6 in Japan.
                        'Keep it Alive!' is a live album recorded at Frontiers Rock Festival in April 2018. This superb
                        performance presents the
                        band in its absolute top form, offering the crowd new songs and several classic tracks.<br><br>
                        In January 2022, Mantis released the current album 'Katharsis'. The album was written and
                        recorded during the Covid
                        pandemic. Therefore, recording an album without the chance to be in a room together was
                        challenging.<br><br>
                        Today, fans will experience the spirit and energy of 1980 with a technical style that
                        compliments today's standards. The
                        band will continue to promote 'Katharsis' and deliver amazing live shows for their fans.
