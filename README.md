# Praying Mantis

Praying Mantis is the official band website for the British rock band Praying Mantis. The site is targeted toward fans of the band as well as concert promoters. The website will give the user an overview of the history and discography of the band, upcoming tour dates and contact information. The band has an outdated website that could use a new layout.
